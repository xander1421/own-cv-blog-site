End-to-end encryption protects your messages. But what about metadata?

Even with Signal's "sealed sender" feature hiding who sent a message, researchers found that delivery receipts create timing patterns. Their Statistical Disclosure Attack can de-anonymize users in as few as 5-10 messages.

The fix? Anonymous Inboxes using blind signatures.

I just published a deep dive on how we implemented this in Chatter, based on the NDSS 2021 paper "Improving Signal's Sealed Sender":

The key insight: decouple user identity from mailbox identity.

1. Users request tokens via blind signatures - the server signs without seeing what it's signing
2. Users create mailboxes anonymously - the server can verify the token but can't link it to any user
3. Messages route through ephemeral mailboxes - the server sees Mailbox A → Mailbox B, never Alice → Bob

The math is elegant: a random blinding factor perfectly masks the data during signing. Two separate server logs exist with zero cryptographic connection between them.

Cost to run at scale? The paper estimates ~$40/month for 10 million daily mailboxes.
